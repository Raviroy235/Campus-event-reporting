# Campus-event-reporting
About this repository

This repo is my small assignment project for campus event reporting system. I tried to make a simple backend using FastAPI with SQLite database.
It is not a full web or mobile app, but just the backend with some APIs and reports to test the idea.

What I have included:

-> FastAPI app inside app/ folder

-> SQLite database file events.db

-> Endpoints to add colleges, students and events

-> APIs to register students, mark their attendance and give feedback

-> Reporting APIs like event popularity, student participation, top 3 students, etc.
